# Google_Maps
In this we deploy the maps on the different stakes of the edmonton.Make a imaginary boundary for each of the stake. For this first of all we run the code where we change the link for the google maps with our own link of the maps where we have all the neighbourhoods locations also the stake with imaginary boundary. after that we make a repositories where we add the requirement and aslo the app file which we get from the code after running through the whole notebook. with this we need to go the streamlit and link our repositories there and finally after that we can see the running web application. I'm also providing my web application https://appmaps-fppjcc83pmus2ewkrcjrhs.streamlit.app/ This code is provided in the class we just modify that code with our own link to the google maps
